  # flakes feedback
  # - flake-overrides.lock: https://github.com/NixOS/nix/issues/4193
  # - I still dislike the registry + special-cased GitHub special URL syntax
  #  -- bonus validation, gitlab repos are weird because they can be nested
  #  -- forcing users to url-encode '/' in their special flake refs
  #  -- some sort of Rust library to always canonicalize URLs, and/or always take args as query strings?
  # - lots of other stuff, too much to get into...
  # - FLAKE_LOCK idea
  # - how do options propagate to remote builders?
  # - remote building in general is a bit weird
