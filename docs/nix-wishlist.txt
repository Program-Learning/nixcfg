flake nixConfig were more useful
actual options get actually plumbed to remote builders
- instead of only ones re-applied on the CLI??? wtf?



# MAJOR ISSUES

1. Remote building is a nightmare
2. The way flakes options (specifically nixConfig) is applied is awful.
3. `nix copy` just shits the bed with too many paths
4. `nix build` doesn't copy derivations/sources with `--no-check-sigs` so they fail
