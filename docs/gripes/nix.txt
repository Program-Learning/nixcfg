remote stuff is terrible
- build graph
- remote store needs to respect a lot more options
- saner defaults for http parallel downloads etc

- launching a remote packet builder is fine, waiting for it to serially download every dep from the cache isnt
- (probably not in nix, but consider) tarball checkpointing _ourselves_ and putting in r2 or something

- maybe the entire config interface needs to be re-thought
- hosts can set limits, or not
- nix tries to be smarter about expanding to the size of the room
- beyond that, requesters can offer build plan config that can override the host's config/defaults, up to its limits
