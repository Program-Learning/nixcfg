rpi-2022
--------

fork of tow-boot
 - rpi work
 - rpi modules/configs
 - tow-boot-nixos integration module

where:
- `./hosts/rpi-*.nix* files` - a replacement for nixos-hardware bits
- `./hosts/rpi*/configuration.nix` - the nixos configurations for each in the "fleet":

fleet:
- rpifour{1,2}: raspberry pi **4b**
- rpithreebp1: raspberry pi **3b+**
- rpizerotwo{1,2}: raspberry pi **zero 2 w**
UNSUPPORTED fleet: (NOT USING TOW-BOOT, but still in repo):
- rpizero{1,2}: raspberry pi **zero w**

features:
 - nix-ified config.txt and rpi-eeprom configuration
 - netboots:
   - fully media-less netboots with nfs persistent storage
   - automatic pieeprom update support
 - rpiboot (wip):
   - rpiboot + netboot for rpi02w
 - sdcard:
   - tested on rpizerotwo{1,2}, but hopefully will be untested soon as netboot takes over
   - but it should be fine
 - (WIP, almost) automated testing with serial capture, remote reset capability with ESP32 assigned to each Pi
