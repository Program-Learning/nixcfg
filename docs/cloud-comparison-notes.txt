## Azure

So much to hate, really.

- no documentation on how to publish a SIG Image publicly, despite a blog post indicating there should be:
  [link]

- only way to publish an image publicly requires creating a "commercial" offering through Azure Marketplace
- this requires... a Microsoft Partner Account which is a pain in the ass 

- the partner center is flat out broken, the nav bar doesn't load (extensions disabled, in fucking Edge)
- lmao, they still don't support ed25519 keys
- more, but I'll stop for now

==> partner network signup-> after entering all company information manually "Accept and continue" takes like a whole minute to finalize somehow

## Oracle

- Pros: has iPXE boot
- Cons: iPXE boot doesn't work from their own storage (which would be cool, you could do custom boot payloads and then
  the VMs all with terranix...)

- ?
